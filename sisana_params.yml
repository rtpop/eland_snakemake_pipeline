# Stage 1: Preprocess data to format for next stage
# example: sisana preprocess params.yml
preprocess:
  exp_file: ./data/Kidney_cortex/gtex_Kidney_cortex_exp.tsv # Path to expression file, which MUST CONTAIN A HEADER
  motif_file: ./data/motif_prior_names_2024.tsv # path to motif file
  ppi_file: ./data/ppi_prior_2024.tsv # path to PPI file
  number: 5 # number of samples a gene must be expressed in
  outdir: ./output/Kidney_cortex/sisana/preprocess # The directory to save the output to

# Stage 2: Reconstruct networks and calculate degrees
# example: sisana generate params.yml
generate:
  processed_paths: ./output/Kidney_cortex/sisana/tmp/processed_data_paths.yml # Path to yaml file containing the location of the processed data files
  method: panda # Which method to use, either "panda" to run just PANDA or "lioness", which runs PANDA first, then LIONESS
  pandafilepath: ./output/Kidney_cortex/sisana/network/panda_network.txt # Path to the panda output file to be created. Must have a .txt extension.
